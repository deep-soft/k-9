# Managing translations

Right now we're using the `resourceConfigurations` mechanism provided by the Android Gradle Plugin to limit which
languages are included in builds of the app.
See e.g. https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/blob/176a520e86bfe6875ad409a7565d122406dc7550/app-k9mail/build.gradle.kts#L40-L48

This list needs to be kept in sync with the string array `supported_languages`, so the in-app language picker offers
exactly the languages that are included in the app.

## Removing a language

1. Remove the language code from the `resourceConfigurations` list in `app-k9mail/build.gradle.kts`.
2. Remove the entry from `supported_languages` in `app/core/src/main/res/values/arrays_general_settings_values.xml`.

## Adding a language

1. Add the language code to the `resourceConfigurations` list in `app-k9mail/build.gradle.kts`.
2. Add an entry to `supported_languages` in `app/core/src/main/res/values/arrays_general_settings_values.xml`.
3. Make sure that `language_values` in `app/core/src/main/res/values/arrays_general_settings_values.xml` contains an
   entry for the language code you just added. If not:
   1. Add the language name (in its native script) to `language_entries` in
      `app/ui/legacy/src/main/res/values/arrays_general_settings_strings.xml`. Please note that this list should be
      ordered using the Unicode default collation order.
   2. Add the language code to `language_values` in `app/core/src/main/res/values/arrays_general_settings_values.xml`
      so that the index in the list matches that of the newly added entry in `language_entries`.

## Things to note

For some languages Android uses different language codes that typical translation tools, e.g. Hebrew's code is _he_ on
Weblate, but _iw_ on Android. When writing automation tools, there needs to be a mapping step involved.

Weblate's code that might be relevant for this:
https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/blob/bdbc725b501e36681766ed3b9ffbb73beeab512d/weblate/formats/base.py

More research and careful testing is necessary when automating any of these steps.
